  <h1>Writing Assignment 1 </h1>
  <p>The software that I personally think is designed well is Microsoft. Microsoft is often said to be a well-designed software due to its several key factors including its functionality and users experience. Microsoft is an easy software to use according to users need. They use users feedback and keep improving the software according to what everyone needed. It has a lot of great features that I find good to use. For instance, auto correct, it helps in many ways such as if I got a spelling or meaning of a sentence wrong it recommends me to change that and gives a good recommendation in place of that word. We have several options for us such as Microsoft teams, outlook, etc. to make our lives easier. One thing I like most about Microsoft is updating regularly to improve new features and improvements. Microsoft software is designed to be versatile as it can be accessible from various devices like laptops, phone, computer, etc. </p>
  <p>Software design is important to create a useful and user-friendly program that everyone can easily use in their comfort zone. Software design is like a blueprint for example if we want to build a building, we also want to have a blueprint for that to have that actual building standing in front of us. Building a good software design makes it easier to manage and update further. Software design impact software’s long-term success. A well design software will allow the system to grow well, and will be in demand by the users. </p>

  <p>Requirements gathering is the first stage of software life cycle models. It is the set of operations that must perform according to user needs. It should be in clear and concise description of what a client needs. Requirement gathering is all about understanding the problems that a software product should solve and perform.   The software product should understand the user needs. Requirement gathering stage is the foundation of all the other stages of software design of the software life cycle. All the software design stages depend on this stage. If this stage is not performed with sufficient time and not pay a good attention to then all the software can’t be as a client wants it to be. Then all other stages will take time to get the things done on the other stages. This is the stage to connect with the clients to get their opinion about what they exactly want in the software though interviews, surveys, observations, etc. Requirement gathering has two types functional and non-functional. Functional is all about what the system should do and non-functional is about in what manner the system will perform, data, user characteristics, etc. Requirements can be gathered through user stories or by user perspectives. User stories should also be simple, concise description of software requirement written from the user’s perspective. These focus on user needs and improves communication, collaboration and discussion.<p>

 <h1>Writing Assignment 4 </h1>
 <p>Communication is an essential part in software design. It ensures all the members to clearly understand the final project, project requirements and goals for the project. A better communication helps to understand the limitations for the project as well. It helps to make the development process more easy and smoother without leading any misunderstanding and conflicts in team members. In the requirement stage, we use communication in writing requirement documents. For the design stage, communication is being used in answering the how question by collaborative efforts of the team members and writing design document. The three main parts of the communication are being clear, listening carefully and giving feedback about the project. And these parts are very crucial for the software design. Being clear means sharing ideas in simple way. Listening carefully helps to understand each other’s view. And feedback allows make   improvement and stay on track. </p>
 <p>In one of my projects in high school, I had a communication problem because I thought my teammates have understood the point of view of how I want to state a thing in the project. Later, I realised they didn’t fully understand and due to that we must make some changes to the project which caused delay of the project. If I had told them about the way I want the project to be with them and asked to their thoughts before and them could collaboratively add their thoughts and my thoughts together and got the project done early. In that project, I have learned that I should ask questions openly and make sure everyone understands, which would have saved so much time in the project. </p>
