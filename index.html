  <h1>Writing Assignment 1 </h1>
  <p>The software that I personally think is designed well is Microsoft. Microsoft is often said to be a well-designed software due to its several key factors including its functionality and users experience. Microsoft is an easy software to use according to users need. They use users feedback and keep improving the software according to what everyone needed. It has a lot of great features that I find good to use. For instance, auto correct, it helps in many ways such as if I got a spelling or meaning of a sentence wrong it recommends me to change that and gives a good recommendation in place of that word. We have several options for us such as Microsoft teams, outlook, etc. to make our lives easier. One thing I like most about Microsoft is updating regularly to improve new features and improvements. Microsoft software is designed to be versatile as it can be accessible from various devices like laptops, phone, computer, etc. </p>
  <p>Software design is important to create a useful and user-friendly program that everyone can easily use in their comfort zone. Software design is like a blueprint for example if we want to build a building, we also want to have a blueprint for that to have that actual building standing in front of us. Building a good software design makes it easier to manage and update further. Software design impact softwareâ€™s long-term success. A well design software will allow the system to grow well, and will be in demand by the users</p>
